>>Why study algs and performance?
-the feasible vs infeasible
-a clear way of thinking about things
-algorithm is like money or currency in economics(wouldn't you rather have food or water or shlter or whatever)
-it's tons of fun

>>First work, then optimize. 

>>After solving a problem, please check these questions:
What data structure and algorithm has been used ?
What's the time and space complexity?
Can you think of other methods to solve it?
Can you come up some follow ups, how to solve them ?
